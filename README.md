- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is @StefanBoon and I'm a very enthusiastic programmer. I started programming at my internship at Pepscan in Lelystad in 2019, mainly in the programming language 'R'.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in making applications that have complex codes and they have to look cool too! Besides coding, my hobbies are playing guitar, producing music, making creative videos for YouTube and American Football!
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C#/XAML, HTML/CSS
